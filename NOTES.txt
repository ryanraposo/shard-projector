INFO BAR

- server/no server:
    Field: "-"

- configure button at rightmost side

- fields:

    - Name
    - Gamemode
    - Max Players
    - Language

    - ~PVP (leave out for now, work in greentext stuff later)~
    - ~Description (leave out for now, figure out multiline handling later)~
    - ~Players (leave out for now, eventually show current/max_players)~
    - ~Tick Rate (leave out for now, until configs return defaults if not explicitly listed, like tick-rate often isn't)~



placement:

    - frame:
        - constant width, best accomplished with column minimums
          that dont expand vs. width=n option for frame

    - field labels:
        - dont need to be uniform size
        - dont need minsize, as field will always be on screen
        - xpadding on top of text size OK

    - value labels:
        - a set amount of space as minimum, approx the size of 
          largest values that may occupy
        - dont want the frame to shift or grow when values are 
          populated








PS

Browse widget should show: Basename (fullpath) 
 - would allow widget to function without knowing biz logic (yes!)
 - accounts for MyDediServer type shit that will exist for sure
 - cluster (server) name will be shown in info bar ^
