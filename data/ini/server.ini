    ; Required: if shard_enabled = true and is_master = false
    ; This is the name of the shard that will show up in log files. It is ignored for the master server, which always has the name [SHDMASTER].

id=

    ; Default: Randomly generated number.
    ; This is field is automatically generated for non-master servers, and is used internally to uniquely identify a server. Altering this or removing it may cause problems on your server if anybody’s character currently resides in the world that this server manages.

[NETWORK]

server_port=

    ; Default: 10999
    ; The UDP port that this server will listen for connections on. If you are running a multi-level cluster, this port must be different for each server on the same machine. This port must be between 10998 and 11018 inclusive in order for players on the same LAN to see it in their server listing. Ports below 1024 are restricted to privileged users on some operating systems.
